    "We use **different forms** of the **word amaze** a total of three times. Each of these different forms is called an **'inflection'**, which is the **modification** of a word to slightly **adjust the meaning or context of the word**. When we tokenize this text we produce three different tokens for each inflection of happy, which is okay but in many applications this level of granularity in the semantic meaning of the word is not required and can damage model performance.\n",
